# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game

Created this game using Transfer Learning

Steps Involved:

1. Data Collection : Used Web Cam to collect the images of rock, paper and scissors.
2. Model Creation and Training : Used a ResNet50 model and trained it using Transfer learning
3. Game in Action : 
    Used openCV to draw 2 boxes on the Web Cam feed.
    It captured frames and passed it to the model.
    Model gave predictions and the predictions for both the frames were compared.
    Accordingly, points were reflected on the screen.
    
It's very easy to train your own model.
Download this code and the steps are mentioned in the notebook itself.
Try to create your own data.

Happy Coding!!
